- Day 11: Seating System


- Due to the local geology, trees in this area only grow on exact integer coordinates in a grid. You make a map (your puzzle input) of the open squares (.) and trees (#) you can see.]



## Description

- Your plane lands with plenty of time to spare. 
- The final leg of your journey is a ferry that goes directly to the tropical island where you can finally start your vacation. 
- As you reach the waiting area to board the ferry, you realize you're so early, nobody else has even arrived yet!

- By modeling the process people use to choose (or abandon) their seat in the waiting area, you're pretty sure you can predict the best place to sit. 
- You make a quick map of the seat layout (your puzzle input).
